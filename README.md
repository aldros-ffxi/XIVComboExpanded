This plugin condenses combos and mutually exclusive abilities onto a single button. 

## Dawntrail update
Every job should be working correctly at lvl 90 and below. Nothing is guaranteed above 90 and some features can break. Please report issues here!

## About
XIVCombo is a plugin to allow for "one-button" combo chains, as well as implementing various other mutually-exclusive button consolidation and quality of life replacements.

For some jobs, this frees a massive amount of hotbar space (looking at you, DRG). For most, it removes a lot of mindless tedium associated with having to press various buttons that have little logical reason to be separate.

## Installation
* Place `https://github.com/daemitus/MyDalamudPlugins/raw/master/pluginmaster.json` in your /xlsettings 3rd party repo list to access this plugin.
* Type `/xlplugins` in-game to access the plugin installer and updater.
* A first-time setup pop-up should appear. 
  
## In-game usage
* Type `/pcombo` to pull up a GUI for editing active combo replacements.
* Drag the named ability from your ability list onto your hotbar to use.
  * For example, to use DRK's Souleater combo, first check the box, then place Souleater on your bar. It should automatically turn into Hard Slash.
  * The description associated with each combo should be enough to tell you which ability needs to be placed on the hotbar.

## Thanks
This fork of attick's XIVCombo was initially [daemitus](https://github.com/daemitus)' work. I have been maintaining it in his stead since he stopped playing the game. 
To ensure a seamless transition, the repository URL remains the same thanks to daemitus' cooperation.
Thanks to Meli for the initial start, and obviously goat for making any of this possible.
